# CMap Tight Packing Fix

## Issue
PDFs generated by Microsoft Word on macOS (Quartz PDFContext) often produce ToUnicode CMap streams with "tightly packed" hex strings, without whitespace between tokens.

Example:
```
2 beginbfrange
<21><21><0052>
<22><22><0065>
endbfrange
```

## The Bug
The previous implementation of `parseBfRangeSection` and `parseBfRangeArray` used `strings.Fields()` to split the line into tokens. This failed when tokens were concatenated (e.g., `<21><21><0052>` became a single token instead of three).

## The Fix
We replaced `strings.Fields()` with a robust loop that searches for `<` and `>` delimiters to extract hex strings, regardless of spacing. This matches the logic already used in `parseBfCharSection`.

## Verification
- Added `TestCMapTightPacking` regression test.
- Verified `pdf-samples/rnb.pdf` now extracts text correctly.
